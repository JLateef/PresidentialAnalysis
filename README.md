# PresidentialAnalysis

This is a pet project of mine where I analyze Barack Obama's inauguration address as well as Donald Trump's, and try to see where the two men distinguish themselves and where they align. This project was primarily to practice text mining, a concept I have been fairly interested in as of late.
The primary coding language used was R. Slight data cleaning was needed before analyzing the text (particularly for Obama's address.) Source data can be found here:
  Obama's inauguration address https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/01/21/president-barack-obamas-inaugural-address
  Trump's inauguration address https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/
